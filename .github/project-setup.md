# GitHub Projects Setup Guide

This guide helps project maintainers set up GitHub Projects for effective task management.

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create the Project Board

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Board" template
5. Name it "Job Connect Hub Development"

### 2. Configure Columns

Set up these columns in order:

| Column | Description | Automation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Backlog** | Future tasks and ideas | None |
| **To Do** | Ready to work on | Auto-add new issues |
| **In Progress** | Currently being worked on | Manual assignment |
| **In Review** | Pull request submitted | Auto-move when PR opened |
| **Done** | Completed tasks | Auto-move when PR merged |

### 3. Create Labels

Add these labels to your repository:

#### Priority Labels
- `priority: high` (red)
- `priority: medium` (yellow)
- `priority: low` (green)

#### Difficulty Labels
- `difficulty: beginner` (light green)
- `difficulty: intermediate` (yellow)

4. **Create contribution guidelines**

### 7. Team Onboarding

#### For New Contributors
1. **Welcome message**: Add a project description
2. **Getting started guide**: Link to README setup instructions
3. **Task assignment**: Explain how to assign themselves to tasks
4. **Communication**: Set up Discord/Slack for questions

#### For Maintainers
1. **Review process**: Define PR review requirements
2. **Task creation**: Guidelines for breaking down features
3. **Labels**: When and how to use different labels
4. **Milestones**: Link tasks to release planning

## Best Practices

### Task Management

- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Label tasks appropriately
- Update progress regularly

### Communication
- Use task comments for progress updates
- Tag team members for feedback

- Use CI/CD checks before merging
- Test changes thoroughly
- Update documentation when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tasks not moving automatically**
- Check automation settings
- Ensure PR properly references issue (#123)
- Verify repository permissions

**New contributors can't find tasks**
- Add more "good first issue" labels
- Improve task descriptions
- Create task templates

**Tasks piling up in "In Progress"**
- Implement task assignment limits
- Regular check-ins with team
- Clear task completion criteria

## Advanced Features
